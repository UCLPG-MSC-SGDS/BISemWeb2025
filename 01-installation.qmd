# Introduction

R (or RStudio) is a statistical programming package that allows users to carry out a wide range of statistical analyses. It can also function as GIS software, enabling various types of analysis on geographical data. In the same way, it can be used for data management and geoprocessing—for example, importing different types of data, whether non-spatial or spatial, and preparing them for analysis.

There are two versions:

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align='center', cache=TRUE,}
knitr::include_graphics('images/general/R_versiontypes.png', error = FALSE) 
```

The famous icon on the left is the version for [**R (Base)**](https://www.r-project.org), and the one on the right is the version for [**RStudio**](https://www.rstudio.com). Both software packages are the same. The only difference is that RStudio is attractive, intuitive, and more importantly, it is user-friendly than Base R. So, we will be using this version (i.e., RStudio) throughout this workshop. 

Let us talk about the installation of RStudio on your personal computer.

## Download and Installation of Software {.unnumbered}

RStudio is an open-source software, it is free. It is widely recommended in data science, scientific research, and technical communication because it is easy to access, download, and install.
