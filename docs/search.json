    "text": "The goal for this session is to get you started with using RStudio, and being familiar with its environment. The session aims to introduce you to the basic programming etiquette, as well as building confidence for using RStudio as a GIS tool. At the end of this session, you should be able to perform some basic data managing tasks as well as generate a choropleth map in RStudio.\n\n\nThe first task includes becoming familiar with its environment and panels. We will begin a soft introduction on the basics of managing data in RStudio. This includes learning how to create various objects in RStudio such as vector and data frame objects. The crucial part of this session we be to know how to the set working directories as well as import your dataset in RStudio. Finally, we will learn how to perform the basic visualisation of spatial data in RStudio.\nLet us begin.\n\n\n\nYou should by now have opened RStudio on your laptop. When opening RStudio for the first time, you are greeted with its interface. The window is split into three panels: 1.) R Console, 2.) Environments and 3.) Files, help & Output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPanel 1: The Console lets the user type in R-codes to perform quick commands and basic calculations.\nPanel 2: The Environments lets the user see which datasets, spatial objects and other files are currently stored in RStudio’s memory\nPanel 3: Under the File tab, it lets the user access other folders stored in the computer to open datasets. Under the Help tab, it also allows the user to view the help menu for codes and commands. Finally, under the Plots tab, the user can perusal his/her generated plots (e.g., histogram, scatterplot, maps etc.).\n\nThe above section is the Menu Bar. You can access other functions for saving, editing, and opening a new Script File for writing codes. Opening a new Script File will reveal a fourth panel above the Console.\nYou can open a Script File by:\n\nClicking on the File tab listed inside the Menu Bar. A scroll down bar will reveal itself. Here, you can scroll to the section that says New File.\nUnder New File, click on R Script. This should open a new Script File titled “Untitled 1”.\n\n\n\n\nThe R console window (i.e., Panel 1) is the place where RStudio is waiting for you to tell it what to do. It will show the code you have commanded RStudio to execute, and it will also show the results from that command. You can type the commands directly into the window for execution as well.\nLet us start by using the console window as a basic calculator for typing in addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), exponents (^) and performing other complex sums.\nClick inside the R Console window and type 19+8, and press enter key button ↵ to get your answer. Quickly perform the following maths by typing them inside the R Console window:\n\n# Perform addition\n19+8\n\n# Perform subtraction\n20-89\n\n# Perform multiplication\n18*20\n\n# Perform division\n27/3\n\n# To number to a power e.g., 2 raise to the power of 8\n2^8\n\n# Perform complex sums\n(5*(170-3.405)/91)+1002\n\nAside from basic arithmetic operations, we can use some basic mathematical functions such as the exponential and logarithms:\n\nexp() is the exponential function\nlog() is the logarithmic function\n\nThese are quite useful functions for transforming or for standardising variables. You can perform the following execution of exp() and log() by typing them inside the R Console window:\n\n# use exp() to apply an exponential to a value\nexp(5) \n\n# use log() to transforrm a value on to a logarithm scale\nlog(3)\n\n\n\n\nNow that we are familiar with using the console as a calculator. Let us build from this and learn one of the most important codes in R programming called the Assignment Operator.\nThis arrow symbol &lt;- is called the Assignment Operator. It is typed by pressing the less than symbol key &lt; followed by the hyphen symbol key -. It allows the user to assign values or entire data structure(s) to an Object.\nObjects are defined as stored quantities in RStudio’s environment. These objects can be assigned anything from numeric values to character string values. For instance, say we want to create a numeric object called x and assign it with a value of 3. We do this by typing x &lt;- 3. When you enter the object x in the console and press enter ↵, it will return the numeric value 3.\nAnother example, suppose we want to create a string object called y and assign it with some text \"Hello!\". We do this typing y &lt;- \"Hello!\". When you enter y in console, it will return the text value Hello.\nLet us create the objects a,b, c, and d and assign them with numeric values. Perform the following by typing them inside the R Console window:\n\n# Create an object called 'a' and assign the value 17 to it\na &lt;- 17\n# Type the object 'a' in console as a command to return value 17\na\n\n# Create an object called 'b' and assign the value 10 to it\nb &lt;- 10\n# Type the object 'b' in console as a command to return value 10\nb\n\n# Create an object called 'c' and assign the value 9 to it\nc &lt;- 9\n# Type the object 'c' in console as a command to return value 9\nc\n\n# Create an object called 'd' and assign the value 8 to it\nd &lt;- 8\n# Type the object 'd' in console as a command to return value 8\nd\n\nNotice how the objects a, b, c and d and its value are stored in RStudio’s environment panel. We can perform the following arithmetic operations with these object values:\n\n# type the following and return an answer\n(a + b + c + d)/5\n\n# type the following and return an answer\n(5*(a-c)/d)^2\n\nLet us create more objects but this time we will assign character string(s) to them. Please note that when typing a string of characters as data you will need to cover them with quotation marks \"...\". For example, say we want to create a string object called y and assign it with some text \"Hello!\". We do this by typing y &lt;- \"Hello!\".\nTry these examples of assigning the following character text to an object:\n\n# Create an object called 'e' and assign the character string \"RStudio\"\ne &lt;- \"RStudio\"\n# Type the object 'e' in the console as a command to return \"RStudio\"\ne\n\n# Create an object called 'f', assign character string \"Hello world\" \nf &lt;- \"Hello world\"\n\n# Type the object 'f' in the console as a command to return \"Hello world\"\nf\n\n# Create an object called 'g' and assign \"Blade Runner is amazing\"\ng &lt;- \"Blade Runner is amazing\"\n# Type the object 'g' in the console to return the result\ng\n\nWe are now familiar with using the console and assigning values (i.e., numeric and string values) to objects. The parts covered here are the initial steps and building blocks for coding and creating datasets in RStudio.\nLet us progress to the next section. Here is where the serious stuff start. We will learn the basics of managing data and some coding etiquette - this includes creating data frames, importing & exporting spreadsheets, setting up work directories, column manipulations and merging two data frames. Learning these basic tasks are key for managing data in R/RStudio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nPoint of no return: From here on out - let us open a script file and type codes there instead of the Console! We are getting serious now, we will never use the Console again."

    "section": "2 Basics of managing data in RStudio",
    "text": "2 Basics of managing data in RStudio\n\n2.1 How do we enter data into RStudio?\nAs you have already seen, RStudio is an object-oriented software package and so entering data is slightly different for the usual way of inputting information into a spreadsheet (e.g., Microsoft Excel). Here, you will need to enter the information as a Vector object before combining them into a Data Frame object.\nConsider this crude example of data containing the additional health information for 4 people. It contains the variable (or column) names ‘id’, ‘name’, ‘height’, ‘weight’ and ‘gender’\n\n\n\nid\nname\nheight\nweight\ngender\n\n\n\n\n1\nKofi\n1.65\n64.2\nM\n\n\n2\nHarry\n1.77\n80.3\nM\n\n\n3\nHuijun\n1.70\n58.7\nF\n\n\n4\nFatima\n1.68\n75.0\nF\n\n\n\nNow, when entering data to RStudio it is not like Microsoft Excel where we enter data into the cells of a spreadsheet. In RStudio, data is entered as a sequence of elements and listed inside an object called a vector. For instance, if we have three age values of 12, 57 and 26 years, and we want to enter this in RStudio, we need to use the combine function c() and combine these three elements into a vector object. Hence, the code will be c(12, 57, 26). We can assign this data by typing this code as age &lt;- c(12, 57, 26). Any time you type ‘age’ into RStudio console it will hence return these three values unless you chose to overwrite it with different information.\nLet us look at this more closely with the 'id' variable in the above data. Each person has an ID number from 1 to 4. We are going to list the numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4 as a sequence of elements into a vector using the combine function c() and then assign it to as a vector object calling it 'id'.\n\n# Create 'id' vector object \nid &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4)\n\n# Type the vector object 'id' in console to see output\nid\n\nNow, let us enter the information the same way for the remaining columns for ‘name’, ‘height’, ‘weight’ and ‘gender’ like we did for ‘id’:\n\n# Create 'name' vector object\nname &lt;- c(\"Kofi\", \"Harry\", \"Huijun\", \"Fatima\")\n\n# Create 'height' (in meters) vector object\nheight &lt;- c(1.65, 1.77, 1.70, 1.68)\n\n# Create 'weight' (in kg) vector object\nweight &lt;- c(64.2, 80.3, 58.7, 75.0)\n\n# Create 'gender' vector object\ngender &lt;- c(\"M\", \"M\", \"F\", \"F\")\n\nNow, that we have the vector objects ready. Let us bring them together to create a proper dataset. This new object is called a Data frame. We need to list the vectors inside the data.frame() function.\n\n# Create a dataset (data frame)\ndataset &lt;- data.frame(id, name, height, weight, gender)\n\n# Type the data frame object 'dataset' in console to see output\ndataset\n\n# You can also see dataset in a data viewer, type View() to data:\nView(dataset)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe column ‘id’ is a numeric variable with integers. The second column ‘name’ is a text variable with strings. The third & fourth columns ‘height’ and ‘weight’ are examples of numeric variables with real numbers with continuous measures. The variable ‘gender’ is a text variable with strings – however, this type of variable is classed as a categorical variable as individuals were categorised as either ‘M’ and ‘F’.\n\n\n\n\n2.2 How do we create a variable based on other existing variables in our data frame?\nTo access a variable by its name within a data frame, you will need to first type the name of the data frame followed by a $ (dollar sign), and then typing the variable’s name of interest. For instance, suppose you just want to see the height values in the Console viewer - you just type:\n\n# to access height - you need to type 'dataset$height'\ndataset$height\n\nWe can use other columns or variables within our data frame to create another variable. This technique is essentially important when cleaning and managing data. From this dataset, it is possible to derive the body mass index bmi from height and weight using the formula:\n\n\n\\(BMI = weight/height^2\\)\n\n\nTo generate bmi into our data frame, we would need to access the height (m) and weight (kg) columns using the $ from the data frame its stored to, and apply the above formula as a code to generate the new bmi column:\n\n# Create 'bmi' in the data frame i.e.,'dataset' and calculate 'bmi'\n# using the $weight and $height\ndataset$bmi &lt;- dataset$weight/((dataset$height)^2)\n# View the data frame ‘dataset’ and you will see the new bmi variable inside\nView(dataset)\n\nYou can overwrite the height (m) column to change its units into centimeters by multiplying it to 100; equally, the weight (kg) column can be overwritten and converted from units of kilograms to grams by multiplying it to 1000.\n\n# using $height and *100 \ndataset$height &lt;- dataset$height*100\n# using $weight and *100\ndataset$weight &lt;- dataset$weight*1000\n# use View() the data frame ‘dataset’ and you will see the updated variables\nView(dataset)\n\n\n\n2.3 How do we set the working directory in our computer by connecting our folder to RStudio with the setwd() function?\nNow, we are getting very serious here!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nBefore we do anything - make sure to have downloaded the data set for this session if you haven’t done so by clicking here. In your computer, create a new folder on your desktop page and rename the folder to “BISemWeb2025”, and create another folder within “BISemWeb2025” and rename it as “Day 1”. Make sure to unzip and transfer ALL the downloaded data directly to the Day 1 folder.\n\n\nNow, this part of the practicals are probably the most important section of this tutorial. It’s usually the “make” or “break” phase (i.e., you will either end-up loving RStudio OR you will end-up hating it and not ever wanting to pick up R again!).\nWe are going to learn how to set-up a working directory. This basically refers to us connecting the RStudio software to the folder containing our dataset. It allows the user to tell RStudio to open data from a folder once it knows the path location. The path location specifies the whereabouts of the data file(s) stored within a computer. Setting your directory in RStudio beforehand makes life incredibly easier in terms of finding, importing, exporting and saving data in and out of RStudio.\nTo illustrate what a path location is – suppose on my desktop (mac/windows) there is a folder called “BISemWeb2025”, and within that folder, exists another folder called “Day 1”. Finally, suppose a comma separated value (.csv) data file called “CIV_Sub_Prefecture_Mosquito_Data.csv” is stored in it (i.e., Day 1). If via RStudio you want to open this CSV data file located in within the “Day 1” folder. You will need to first set the path to the “Day 1” folder in RStudio using the setwd() function.\nTherefore, the path location to this folder on a Windows machine would be written as follows, \"C:/Users/accountName/Desktop/BISemWeb2025/Day 1\". You can access this piece of information simply by:\n\nOpen the BISemWeb2025 folder to reveal the Day 1 folder.\nOpen the Day 1 folder in the data files are stored.\nNow, click on the bar at the top which shows BISemWeb2025 &gt; Day 1. This should highlight and show \"C:\\Users\\accountName\\Desktop\\BISemWeb2025\\Day 1\" (see image below):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, copy \"C:\\Users\\accountName\\Desktop\\BISemWeb2025\\Day 1\" and paste the path name into the setwd() function in your R script.\nLastly, change all the back slashes \\ in the path name to forward slashes / and run the code. It should look like this: setwd(\"C:/Users/accountName/Desktop/BISemWeb2025/Day 1\").\n\nFor Windows, the setwd() is as follows:\n\n# set work directory in windows\nsetwd(\"C:/Users/accountName/Desktop/BISemWeb2025/Day 1\")\n\nFor MAC users, its marginally different. The path location would be written as follows, \"/Users/accountName/Desktop/BISemWeb2025/Day 1\". You can access this piece of information simply by:\n\nRight-clicking on the folder “Week 1” (not file) in which the files are stored.\nHold the “Option” ⌥ key down\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Copy \"filename\" as Pathname\nPaste the copied path name into the function setwd() and run the code\n\nFor Mac, the setwd() is as follows:\n\n# set work directory in macs\nsetwd(\"/Users/accountName/Desktop/BISemWeb2025/Day 1\")\n\nThis should set the working directory. Now, let us learn how to import a CSV data into RStudio.\n\n\n2.4 How do we import, merge and export CSV data with RStudio?\n\n2.4.1 Importing data using read.csv()\nAs you will be working mostly with comma separated value formatted data (i.e., csv) we will therefore learn how to import and export in RStudio. There are two files that we are going to import into RStudio from Week 1’s folder:\n\nLondon_LSOA_Deprivation_2019.csv which contains information on seven indicators (as scores) and an IMD ranking for socioeconomic deprivation for 4,836 postcodes across London in 2019.\nLondon_LSOA_FireHazards_2019.csv which contains details about the observed and estimated expected number of fire-related accidents to have occurred in residential premises with the overall number of houses in 4,836 postcodes across London in 2019.\n\nTo import a csv into RStudio, we use the read.csv() function. To demonstrate this, let us import the data for fires into an data frame object and name it as Fire_data\n\n# Import data using read.csv() function \nFire_data &lt;- read.csv(file=\"London_LSOA_FireHazards_2019.csv\", header = TRUE, sep = \",\")\n\nJust in case…suppose if we did NOT set the working directory earlier. We would have to go through the hassle of typing the path location in the read.csv().\nFor windows:\n\nFire_data &lt;- read.csv(file=\"C:/Users/accountName/Desktop/GEOG0114/Week 1/London_LSOA_FireHazards_2019.csv\", header = TRUE, sep = \",\")\n\nFor Mac:\n\nFire_data &lt;- read.csv(file=\"/Users/accountName/Desktop/GEOG0114/Week 1/London_LSOA_FireHazards_2019.csv\", header = TRUE, sep = \",\")\n\nI do not recommend doing it this way. Just set the work directory with setwd() to make life easier for yourself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe arguments used in read.csv() function – 1.) ‘file =’ is a mandatory option where you quote the name of the file to be imported; 2.) ‘header = TRUE’ option is set to TRUE which is telling RStudio that the file that is about to be imported has column names on the first row so it should not treat as observations; and 3.) ‘sep = \",\"’ we are telling RStudio that the format of the dataset is comma separated.\n\n\nWe have imported the fire hazards data. Now, let us import the second data for deprivation using the read.csv() function and call it Deprivation_data. The code would look something as follows:\n\n# Import data using read.csv() function \nDeprivation_data &lt;- read.csv(file=\"London_LSOA_Deprivation_2019.csv\", header = TRUE, sep = \",\")\n\n# Show viewer the data sets\nView(Deprivation_data)\nView(Fire_data)\n\n\n\n2.4.2 Joining two datasets by merger using the merge() function\nYou will often find yourself merging two or more data frames together, especially bringing together a spatial object with a non-spatial object. We cannot stress the importance of merging objects in the correct order so that the spatial attributes are preserved.\nIn this instance, we are just dealing with two ordinary dataset which are non-spatial - i.e., one data set contains information on Fires that occurred in geographic units in London know as Lower Super Output Areas (LSOA), while the other contains its corresponding information for socioeconomic indicators that describe the LSOA. Hence, it is possible to merge the two data frames uniquely using a common key variable like LSOA_code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis task can be done using the merge function merge(). Consequently, we want the format of the merge code to look something akin to this syntax merge(target_object, selected_object, by=”LSOA”).\nMerging data frames is indeed a very important technique to know especially if you need to bring together event information with no spatial dimension with actual spatial data. Alright, let’s merge the deprivation data on the fire records using the LSOA_code column, and generate a bigger data frame that contains both the fire and socioeconomic information:\n\n# Using the merge() function \nFull_data &lt;- merge(Fire_data, Deprivation_data, by.x = “LSOA_code”, by.y = “LSOA_code”, all.x = TRUE)\n\n# View the datasets\nView(Full_data)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe arguments used in merge.csv():\n\nFire_data is the target data frame we want something to be merged on to.\nDeprivation_data is the selected data frame we are using to merge with the Fire_data.\nby.x = \"LSOA_code\" option we are specifying the name of the join column from the target data frame i.e., Fire_data.\nby.y = \"LSOA_code\" option we are specifying the name of the join column from the selected data frame i.e., Deprivation_data\nall.x=TRUE option we are telling RStudio to retain all rows that are originally from the target data after merging regardless of whether or not they are present in the selected data frame. So even if a row from the selected data does not find a unique link with any of the rows in target data to match too - it will still preserve the target data frame by not discarding unlinked rows. But it will discard the unmatched rows from the selected data frame.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4.3 Saving your dataset using the write.csv() function\nLet us save a version of this as a .csv file as a saved product named “London_Fire_and_Deprivation_2019.csv”. This can be done by using the write.csv() function. It will export the data frame object into a .csv format.\n\n# Export ‘Full_data’ object as .csv into 'Week 1' folder\nwrite.csv(Full_data, file = \"London_Fire_and_Deprivation_2019.csv\", row.names = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe arguments used in merge.csv():\n\nFull_data is an object we are exporting. It is compulsory to specify the object data frame we want to export\nfile = is a mandatory argument. We must give a name to the file we wish to export it as with .csv extension.\nrow.names = this is an annoying argument! It will automatically index the dataset with unique row numbers by default if we do not specify FALSE! Since the data has its own unique identifiers (i.e., LSOA_code) we specify ‘FALSE’ to not perform this action of indexing\n\n\n\nAgain, suppose if you did NOT set the work directory to your folder, you will have to type the whole path location to where you want the data to be exported which could be a hassle:\nFor Windows:\n\nwrite.csv(Full_data, file = \"C:/Users/accountName/Desktop/GEOG0114/Week 1/London_Fire_and_Deprivation_2019.csv\", row.names = FALSE)\n\nFor Mac:\n\nwrite.csv(Full_data, file = \"/Users/accountName/Desktop/GEOG0114/Week 1/London_Fire_and_Deprivation_2019.csv\", row.names = FALSE)\n\nAgain, I do not recommend doing it this way. Just set the work directory with setwd() to make life easier for yourself and to avoid R calling you out for errors.\nNow that we have learned a lot of the basic things in RStudio – the stuff shown in section 1.3 will be used quite a lot in future tutorials. Let us progress to the section 1.4 where will start using RStudio as a GIS software. Here, we will create our first map to display the spatial distribution of socioeconomic deprivation using the Full_data data frame object."

    "text": "3 Basic visualisation of spatial data in RStudio\n\n3.1 Installing packages into RStudio\nSo far, we have been using functions and commands that are by default built-in RStudio. As you will become more and more proficient in RStudio, you will come to realise that there are several functions in RStudio that are in fact not built-in by default which will require external installation.\nFor instance, the sf package which is called Simply Features allows the user to load shapefiles (a type of Vector spatial data) into RStudio’s memory. Another important package is called tmap, this package gives access to various functions that allows the user to write code and emulate RStudio as a GIS software. These are examples of packages with enables mapping of spatial data. They need to be installed as they not built-in programs in RStudio.\nLet us install following packages: tmap and sf using the install.packages() function, and then activate the packages to make them active using the library() function.\nFirst install remotes, tmap and sf packages.:\n\ninstall.packages(\"sf\")\ninstall.packages(\"tmap\")\n\nOnce the installation is complete, you MUST activate the packages using the library() function. Type the following to perform this action:\n\n# Active the sf and tmap packages\nlibrary(\"sf\")\nlibrary(\"tmap\")\n\n\n\n3.2 Adding shapefiles in RStudio\nThe sf package grants the user access to a function called read_sf() to read-in shapefiles into RStudio. A shapefile typically contains the geometry of the spatial features e.g., points, line segment and boundaries of an areal feature etc. The shapefile has the extension of .shp (and it is always accompanied by its other supporting files with extensions .shx, .prj, .dbf and .cpg).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nFollowing files must all be stored in the same folder location with .shp file (i.e., .shx, .prj, .dbf and .cpg). If one is missing - the .shp file will not work!\n\n\nWe have two types of shapefiles:\n\nLondon_LSOA_Areas.shp which contains the spatial boundaries of all LSOA postcodes in London.\nLondon_Borough_Shapefile.shp which contains the spatial boundaries for all 33 Boroughs in London.\n\nWe can easily load them in RStudio as Spatial Polygon objects, type into your script:\n\n# Add shapefiles for LSOA and Boroughs\nlondon_lsoa_shapefile &lt;- read_sf(\"London_LSOA_areas.shp\")\nlondon_borough_shapefile &lt;- read_sf(\"London_Boroughs_Shapefile.shp\")\n\nWe interested in visualising the data at an LSOA-level. We would need to merge the non-spatial (aka ordinary) data i.e., Full_data, uniquely in to the Spatial Polygon object we loaded in previously i.e., london_lsoa_shapefile, using the LSOA_code column.\nAgain, we can use the merge() function to perform this task the same way we carried out the joining of the two ordinary data frames in section 1.3.4.2. Consequently, we want the format of the merge code to look something akin to this syntax merge(target_spatial_object, selected_non_spatial_object, by=\"LSOA\").\n\n# Using the merge() function \nSpatial_data &lt;- merge(london_lsoa_shapefile, Full_data, by.x = \"LSOA_code\", by.y = \"LSOA_code\", all.x = TRUE)\n\n# View the datasets\nView(Spatial_data)\n\n\n\n3.3 Mapping with ‘tmap’ functions in RStudio\nThe tmap is the best package for creating maps in RStudio – it’s easy to code and user friendly. Let’s finally start some mapping! Here are some basic ‘tmap’ functions to be very familiar with:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntmap functions\nWhat it does…\n\n\n\n\ntm_shape()\nThis allows the user to add layers to be mapped\n\n\ntm_polygons()\nThis deal with vector type dataset specifically. This allows the user to specify which column in the vector layer to be mapped using the fill = argument. Within the tm_polygon(), it also allows the user to apply the appropriate customisation to the vector layer. Examples of such arguments in 1.) fill_alpha = to modify the transparency; 2.) col_alpha = to modify the transparency of the borders; 3.) col = controls the colour of the line; 4.) fill.scale = controls the appearence and set the colour scheme of the scale that appears inside the legends block. Please note that if your data is continuous, then the appropriate argument to use in the fill.scale = would be either tm_scale_continuous() or tm_scale_interval() for breaking the continuous values into intervals. If they are numerical but discrete (counts) use tm_scale_discrete(). Otherwise, if it is categorical use tm_scale_categorical(); and 4.) fill.legend = tm_legend(...) allows the user to control the presentation of the legend. There are many arguments to experiment with - you can type ?tm_polygons() in console to see them. Please note that the tm_polygons() is immediately followed after specifying the tm_shape() function.\n\n\ntm_layout()\nThis allows the user to make heavy customisations to the main title, legends and other cosmetics to text sizes etc.\n\n\ntm_compass()\nThis allows the user to add a compass visual to the map output\n\n\ntm_scale_bar()\nThis allows the user to add a scale bar to the map output\n\n\n\n\n3.3.1 Visualising the outline(s) of study area\nSuppose you want to visual just the outline of London’s LSOA only:\n\n# Visual outline of London’s LSOA postcodes only\ntm_shape(Spatial_data) + tm_polygons()\n\n# Insert the “Spatial_data” object into the command line of \n# tm_shape(). No customisation has been applied here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can customise the level of transparency for both the area and borders by adding some arguments in the tm_polygon() [i.e., fill_alpha, and col_alpha which only take values between 0 (full transparency) to 1 (100% solid)]. For example:\n\n# Controlling transparencies for borders and areas\n\ntm_shape(Spatial_data) + \n    tm_polygons(fill_alpha = 0.1, col_alpha = 0.4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.2 Adding another layer on top of study area\nSuppose you want to add another layer to show the regions (i.e., Borough) of London for which the LSOA areas reside in, you can use another tm_shape() in the code, the coding would be as follows:\n\n# Adding another layer\n\ntm_shape(Spatial_data) + \n    tm_polygons(fill_alpha = 0.1, col_alpha = 0.4) +\ntm_shape(london_borough_shapefile) +\n    tm_polygons(fill_alpha = 0, col_alpha = 1, col = \"black\")\n\n# The background of the added layer (london_borough_shapefile) has been rendered \n# to full transparency with the fill_alpha set to 0 and it borders are fully solid \n# using col_alpha set to 1 and col (colour) set to “black” to appear pronounced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.3 Full visualising of data in the maps\nSuppose you want to visual the spatial data in those postcodes, we can use the tm_polygons() function. Let us visual the IMD_Decile column which has DISCRETE (or CATEGORICAL) values classed from 1 to 10 to signify areas that are deprived (with 1 being the poorest) and those that are wealthier (with 10 being the least deprived).\nThe coding would be as follows:\n\n# Generate map IMD_Deciles\n\ntm_shape(Spatial_data) +\n    tm_polygons(\n        fill = \"IMD_Decile\", \n        fill.scale = tm_scale_categorical(values = \"brewer.rd_yl_gn\"),\n        fill.legend = tm_legend(title = \"Deprivation (Deciles)\", frame = FALSE, item.space = -0.2, position = tm_pos_out()),\n        fill_alpha = 1, \n        col_alpha = 0.5, \n        col = \"black\", \n        lwd = 0.1) +\n    tm_shape(london_borough_shapefile) + \n    tm_polygons(fill_alpha = 0, col = \"black\") +\n    tm_compass(type = \"arrow\", position = c(\"right\", \"top\")) + \n    tm_scalebar(position = c(\"left\", \"bottom\"))\n\nIn the tm_polygons(), we insert the variable of interest we want to visual at the fill = argument. The fill.scale = option allows us to select the appropriate fill scale colour scheme depending on the type of dataset we are using - here it is categorical, so we use tm_scale_categorical(). The fill_legend() allows us to apply the appropriate customisation to the legends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nGeography 101 – when creating a map, it is always best to add the North compass and scale bar. This is done with the tm_compass() and tm_scalebar() functions. The tm_layout() allows you to make further customisations to the internal and external plot region of map such as turning of the plot frame or modifying the text size in output. You can experiment with them by checking the help menu – just type: ?tm_layout() in the console.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis concludes this computer lab session. Challenge yourself with the task placed in section 1.6"

    "text": "6 Exercise\nExploring the burden of fire hazards and vulnerability in London\nAn incidence rate (IR) is typically a measure of frequency used to quantify the occurrence of an event.\nThis basic quantitative measure is often applied in social sciences (e.g., criminology for crime rates, in education on pass rates for grades), epidemiology and disaster sciences as well. The study of fire hazards and safety is an intersection of these three fields.\nObjectives: Use the spatial data you have built throughout the exercise to visualise the distribution of incidence of fires that occurred in residential premises across postcodes in London in 2019.\nHINTS:\n\nThe incidence rate (I) formula for calculating fires hazards across LSOAs in London is the reported number of residential premises in an LSOA that experienced a fire event (E) divided by the total number of residential premises in an LOSA (T). This is shown below expressed per 1,000 residence (per capita). The reported number of residential premises is the column Fires2019. The total number of houses in an LSOA is the column TotalHouses2019 The incidence rate formula is:\n\n\n\n\\(I  = (E/T) × 1000\\)\n\n\n\nExperiment with the tmap functions and arguments to create a map showing the incidence rate of fire hazards across LSOAs in London. The output should look something as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the tm_shape() functions to add the spatial data frame object with the incidence rates.\nIn the arguments for the tm_polygons() function, inside it, it should include the following codes: 1.) use the argument fill= to specify the name of the column to be mapped; 2.) use the argument fill.scale = tm_scale_continuous() to control how the scale in the legends should appear. It should be continuous as the incidence rates are continuous values. Therefore, within the tm_scale_continuous() argument, use the options values = to control the colour gradient from blue (i.e., low intensity of fire hazards) to red (i.e., high burden) by typing the colour scheme: “-brewer.rd_bu”; 3.) use the argument fill.legend = tm_legend() to control the appearence of the legend block. Inside the tm_legend() specific title = as “Fires per 1,000”, and remove the plot frame around the legend block by stating frame = FALSE; 4.) apply the further cosmetics changes using \"fill_alpha = 1\" (transparency of areas), col_alpha = 0.5 (transparency of lines), col = \"grey\" (color of the line) and lwd = 0.1 (line thickness).\nInclude the following customizations: 1.) a scale bar and a north arrow in the visualisation using the tm_scale_bar() and tm_compass(); and 2.) lastly, use the overlay of the London Borough shapefile add it on top of the London LSOA shapefile by using again, the tm_shape() function, and render it fully transparent. Try using the tm_text() function to include the names of the Boroughs in the visualisation - this column is called ctyua16nm in the Borough’s shapefile.\n\nQuestion: How would you provide a descriptive interpretation of the spatial distribution/incidence of residential fires across LSOAs in London?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nHave a go at these questions before revealing the solution codes and output below\n\n\n\n\nClick here to see solution code:\n\nLoad the required packages:\n\nlibrary(\"tmap\")\nlibrary(\"sf\")\n\nLoad in the required dataset i.e., London_LSOA_FireHazards_2019.csv using the read.csv() function:\n\n# please be sure set the work directory according to your own PC\n# setwd(\"/Users/anwarmusah/Documents/Websites/GEOG0114/all_datasets/Week 1 - Dataset\")\n\nFire_data &lt;- read.csv(file=\"London_LSOA_FireHazards_2019.csv\", header = TRUE, sep = \",\")\n\nLoad in the required shapefile dataset i.e., London_LSOA_areas.shp and London_Boroughs_Shapefile.shp using the read_sf() function:\n\n# Add shapefiles for LSOA and Boroughs\nlondon_lsoa_shapefile &lt;- read_sf(\"London_LSOA_areas.shp\")\nlondon_borough_shapefile &lt;- read_sf(\"London_Boroughs_Shapefile.shp\")\n\nMerge the fire records to LSOA shapefile using the merge() on common key column (e.g., LSOA_code):\n\nSpatial_data &lt;- merge(london_lsoa_shapefile, Fire_data, by.x = 'LSOA_code', by.y = 'LSOA_code', all.x = TRUE)\n\nCalculate the incidence of fires in London’s LSOA:\n\n# Calculate the incidence rate. \n# This requires creating a new variable in the `Spatial_data` data frame.\n# Let call the new variable 'IncidenceFires'. \n# We are creating the 'IncidenceFires' column based on 'Fires2019' and 'TotalHouses2019'\n# Its a rate per capita so we will divide the two and multiple it by 1000\n\nSpatial_data$IncidenceFires &lt;- (Spatial_data$Fires2019/Spatial_data$TotalHouses2019)*1000\n\nLet’s create the map that shows the burden of fires. Here, we will use a continuous scale for the colour gradient in the legend block:\n\n# Generate a incidence map 'with continuous scale' according to the criteria specified in the hints\ntm_shape(Spatial_data) + \n    tm_polygons(\"IncidenceFires\",\n        fill.scale = tm_scale_continuous(values = \"-brewer.rd_bu\", midpoint = 1.5),\n        fill.legend = tm_legend(title = \"Fires per 1,000\", frame = FALSE),\n        fill_alpha = 1,\n        col_alpha = 0.5,\n        col = \"white\",\n        lwd = 0.1) +\n    tm_shape(london_borough_shapefile) + \n    tm_polygons(fill_alpha = 0, col = \"black\") +\n    tm_text(\"ctyua16nm\", size = \"AREA\", fontface = \"bold\") +\n    tm_compass(type = \"arrow\", position = c(\"right\", \"top\")) + \n    tm_scalebar(position = c(\"left\", \"bottom\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nInterpretation: From this static map, it is difficult to discern the spatial patterns in incidence of fire hazards in residential dwellings in LSOAs in London. For instance, Boroughs such as Hackney appears to have a dispersed pattern with some LSOAs reporting high incidence rates. The borough of Bexley has high incidence rates concentrated in the North-East.\n\n\nYou can make this an interactive map by using the tmap_mode(\"view\") code. Let us print this output in an interactive map, so we can zoom into the details and have a clearer picture:\n\n# to map interactive using tmap_mode(\"view\") code, and re-run the map code again\n\n# active interactive mode\ntmap_mode(\"view\")\n# re-run the map code again to show it in an interactive mode\ntm_shape(Spatial_data) + \n    tm_polygons(\"IncidenceFires\",\n        fill.scale = tm_scale_continuous(values = \"-brewer.rd_bu\", midpoint = 1.5),\n        fill.legend = tm_legend(title = \"Fires per 1,000\", frame = FALSE),\n        fill_alpha = 1,\n        col_alpha = 0.5,\n        col = \"white\",\n        lwd = 0.1) +\n    tm_shape(london_borough_shapefile) + \n    tm_polygons(fill_alpha = 0, col = \"black\") +\n    tm_text(\"ctyua16nm\", size = \"AREA\", fontface = \"bold\") +\n    tm_compass(type = \"arrow\", position = c(\"right\", \"top\")) + \n    tm_scalebar(position = c(\"left\", \"bottom\"))\n\n# switch off the interactive mode\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nBy running the code: tmap_mode(\"view\"), will cause all map outputs to be generated in interactivity mode. You can switch it off by running the following code: tmap_mode(\"plot\")"

    "text": "R (or RStudio) is a statistical programming package that allows users to carry out a wide range of statistical analyses. It can also function as GIS software, enabling various types of analysis on geographical data. In the same way, it can be used for data management and geoprocessing—for example, importing different types of data, whether non-spatial or spatial, and preparing them for analysis.\nThere are two versions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe famous icon on the left is the version for R (Base), and the one on the right is the version for RStudio. Both software packages are the same. The only difference is that RStudio is attractive, intuitive, and more importantly, it is user-friendly than Base R. So, we will be using this version (i.e., RStudio) throughout this workshop.\nLet us talk about the installation of RStudio on your personal computer.\n\n\nRStudio is an open-source software, it is free. It is widely recommended in data science, scientific research, and technical communication because it is easy to access, download, and install. To use RStudio, you must first install R (Base) before installing RStudio as it serves as an engine to RStudio. Follow the steps below to install both programs for your operating system (Windows or Mac).\nSteps\n\nDownload the R (Base) installer from the table below, then run the file to complete the installation.
