```

Welcome to the 2-day practical session. Part of this workshop is to deliver an interactive training session on **Introductory Spatial Data Analysis in RStudio** for basic mapping for any particular indicators in **Cote D'Ivoire**. We will be using mosquito dataset from the World Health Organisation (WHO) to build intuition on programming & data handling as aspect in RStudio. 

This training session has been designed **purely** as an introduction to show the core programming tenets for basic spatial analysis in RStudio. This online resource are **free of charge**, and thus has been designed as reference to this session and will remain available indefinitely to participants.
