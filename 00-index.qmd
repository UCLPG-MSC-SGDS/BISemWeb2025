```

Welcome to the 2-day practical session hosted at [**BISemWeb 2025 @ ENSEA (Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire)**](https://sites.google.com/view/bisemweb25/home). Part of this computer practical session is to deliver an interactive training session on **Introductory Spatial Data Analysis in RStudio** for basic mapping for any particular indicators in **Cote d'Ivoire**. We will be using mosquito insecticide treatment dataset from the World Health Organisation (WHO) to build intuition on the programming & data handling aspects in RStudio. 

This training session has been designed **purely** as an introduction to show the core programming tenets for basic spatial analysis in RStudio. This online resource is **free of charge**, and thus has been designed as reference to this session and will remain available indefinitely to participants.
